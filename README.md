# NoSQL MongoDB and Mongoose
## Social-App-Base
It's more than common to discover new apps every day, while devs spend time creating new apps and debugging existing codebases, most developers spend most of their time researchiong, reading and writing so the question is, why spend so much time constructing the wheel when it's already created? Well good news, here's a base... The purpose of this excersice was to create a social app base where users can create a profile, create posts and like other posts.

The purpose of this project was to execute and controll a NoSQL database and its routes. This application uses MongoDB database and Mongoose ODM syntaxis for models.

### Built With:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/index)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com)
- [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

## Installation
1. To install this application, `git clone` this repo.
2. Install ***all*** of the npm packages listed above via command-line in terminal with `npm i -y`
3. The application can be accessed by visiting `http://localhost:3001` in the browser after running the following command:
```
`npm start` or
`node server.js`
```
4. [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/) or [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) can be used to check the backend functionality.

## Learning Curve
* While creating this app I learned and practice:
1. Created Models using Mongoose and its middleware to automate functionality.
2. Implemented Mongooseâ€™s prebuilt methods for CRUD operations.
3. Create a relationship between two models.
4. Work with subdocuments in Mongoose and implemented getters and virtuals with Mongoose.
5. Added Match Validation.
